# umubuilder
A build script for Proton with custom patches and support for GloriousEggroll's umu-launcher (version 0.01)

Warning: the installation step may fail because of a step (hack) that copies files from `/usr/{i686,x86_64}-w64-mingw/`, which may not exist on your platform.

This is non-fatal, and the built archive should be left in the script directory.
