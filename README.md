# umubuilder
A build script for Proton with custom patches and support for GloriousEggroll's umu-launcher (version 0.01)

Works with umu-run winetricks like proton-ge-custom and umu-proton.

# Credit
Of course, none of this would be possible without the teams behind Proton and Wine, but I'd like to give special credit to:
- [loathingKernel](https://github.com/loathingKernel) for putting together the [version](https://github.com/CachyOS/proton-cachyos) of Proton that this build script uses
- The team behind [Open-Wine-Components](https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/) for making using Proton outside of Steam as easy as this
